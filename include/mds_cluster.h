 * mds_cluster.h -- Backend-neutral cluster services interface.
 *
 * Multi-MDS operation needs four services from the catalogue store
 * besides the catalogue data itself: a node registry (which MDS is
 * alive, where, and since which boot epoch), a heartbeat on that
 * registry, a stale-peer scan for the failover watchdog, and the
 * partition map (which MDS owns which namespace subtree).  This header
 * is the backend-neutral surface for those services.  A backend
 * implements them through struct mds_cluster_ops (catalogue_internal.h)
 * and the dispatchers below forward to it.
 *
 * Every slot is optional.  A backend that leaves a slot NULL makes the
 * matching dispatcher return MDS_ERR_NOSUPPORT, and every status a slot
 * does return reaches the caller unchanged.  mds_cluster_supported()
 * tells the daemon whether the store can carry a multi-process cluster
 * at all; an in-process store may populate the slots for tests without
 * ever claiming that.
 *
 * Contract notes shared by every slot:
 *   - A scan callback returning non-zero stops the scan; the scan then
 *     returns MDS_OK.
 *   - Callbacks may call back into the same catalogue handle (C1 in
 *     catalogue_internal.h), so a backend never holds a non-reentrant
 *     lock or an open retry body across a callback.
 *   - Rows are bounded by MDS_MAX_NODES (node registry) and the
 *     configured partition count, so every scan is small.

 * Node registry
 *
 * One row per mds_id.  boot_epoch identifies one incarnation of an MDS
 * and must be monotonic across restarts of the same mds_id; it is what
 * lets the store tell a restarted node from a stale one.  The daemon
 * derives it from CLOCK_REALTIME nanoseconds at startup (main.c), so
 * it stays monotonic across host reboots as long as the wall clock is
 * not stepped back below the previous incarnation's value; when it is,
 * node_register refuses with MDS_ERR_EXISTS and the daemon exits with
 * a message naming the row and both epochs rather than continuing
 * unregistered.
 *
 * Contract (binding on every backend; RonDB and memdb implement it):
 *
 *   node_register    conditional upsert: insert when absent; replace
 *                    when the existing row's boot_epoch is lower;
 *                    MDS_ERR_EXISTS when a row with an equal or higher
 *                    boot_epoch exists (a duplicate live mds_id is
 *                    split-brain and is refused).
 *   node_heartbeat   update the heartbeat timestamp only when the row
 *                    exists AND its boot_epoch equals @boot_epoch;
 *                    MDS_ERR_NOTFOUND when absent; MDS_ERR_STALE on an
 *                    epoch mismatch (an old incarnation stops
 *                    heartbeating and never overwrites its replacement).
 *                    One conditional write, no read-before-write.
 *   node_deregister  delete only when the row's boot_epoch equals
 *                    @boot_epoch; MDS_OK when the row is already absent
 *                    (a retried shutdown is harmless); MDS_ERR_STALE on
 *                    an epoch mismatch, nothing deleted.
 *   timestamps       the writer's CLOCK_REALTIME in nanoseconds, so the
 *                    watchdog's threshold (its own CLOCK_REALTIME) is in
 *                    the same clock domain across hosts; the stale
 *                    threshold (15 s default) must therefore exceed the
 *                    deployment's NTP skew bound.
 *
 * Consumer rule for last_heartbeat_ns (rolling upgrade): RonDB writers
 * that predate this contract stamped CLOCK_MONOTONIC, a value that can
 * never reach FAILOVER_HB_REALTIME_FLOOR_NS (failover_watchdog.h,
 * 2020-01-01 UTC) in the realtime domain.  A row below that floor is
 * INDETERMINATE: the failover watchdog skips its tick for that partner
 * and never declares it stale, so an upgraded standby cannot promote
 * against a not-yet-upgraded primary; the node_list consumer
 * (cluster_membership_populate) does not interpret the timestamp at
 * all.  The store applies no such rule -- it reports rows below the
 * threshold as asked.
