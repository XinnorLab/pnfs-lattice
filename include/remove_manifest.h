 * remove_manifest.h — Async-REMOVE delete manifest (mds.conf
 * `remove_async`, RonDB schema v18).
 *
 * Design summary
 * --------------
 * op_remove's synchronous cost floor is the ns_remove NDB transaction
 * (~0.65 ms measured on the lab).  With `remove_async = true`,
 * eligible REMOVEs are acked after a much cheaper durable step:
 *
 *   1. an in-memory TOMBSTONE keyed (dir_fileid, name) hides the
 *      dirent from every read path (LOOKUP/OPEN/READDIR) immediately;
 *   2. one mds_remove_pending row (single-row NDB insert, ~0.3 ms)
 *      records the pending delete durably — RonDB replication makes
 *      it rack-safe and any-MDS resumable;
 *   3. the reply is sent; the manifest DRAINER executes the real
 *      guarded ns_remove + final-unlink cleanup off the request
 *      thread (batched claims, ownership leases, crash re-claim —
 *      exactly the mds_unlink_pending drainer pattern).
 *
 * Because the manifest row commits BEFORE the client is acked, an
 * MDS crash never resurrects an acknowledged remove: the row is
 * re-loaded into tombstones at startup (remove_manifest_load) and
 * drained by this or any peer MDS.
 *
 * Invariants
 * ----------
 *   1. A tombstone exists for every manifest row this node serves
 *      reads for (submit inserts the tombstone first; load rebuilds
 *      them before RPC listeners start).
 *   2. Exactly one executor per entry: the PENDING -> DRAINING
 *      transition under the stripe lock elects either a drainer
 *      worker or a force-drain caller; the loser skips or waits.
 *   3. Mutations that would collide with a pending delete
 *      (CREATE/RENAME onto the name, RMDIR of the parent) must call
 *      the force-drain helpers first, so the catalogue never sees a
 *      double dirent and RMDIR emptiness stays truthful.
 *   4. destroy() drains every remaining tombstone synchronously —
 *      a graceful shutdown leaves no pending manifest work behind.
 *
 * v1 deployment gate (enforced by main.c, not here): single-MDS or
 * strict-subtree-sharded clusters only, same convention as
 * inode_cache_multi_mds_unsafe — tombstone visibility is node-local.
