 * fdb_txn.h -- FoundationDB backend handle and transaction runner.
 *
 * Every catalogue slot of the FoundationDB backend is ONE call to
 * fdb_run_txn(): the runner opens a transaction, runs the caller's body
 * (reads, decisions, mutations), commits, and turns every FoundationDB
 * error into exactly one of the catalogue's statuses.  A body never
 * calls back into the caller (contract C2, catalogue_internal.h): it
 * fills a bounded, caller-owned page and the slot delivers that page
 * after fdb_run_txn() returned.
 *
 * Error classification (by numeric code; names may change, codes are
 * stable):
 *   1020 not_committed and everything
 *   fdb_error_predicate(FDB_ERROR_PREDICATE_RETRYABLE_NOT_COMMITTED)
 *   accepts (1007 transaction_too_old, 1009 future_version, ...)
 *                          definitive abort: the body is re-run after
 *                          fdb_transaction_on_error's backoff, within
 *                          the operation deadline; exhausted -> DELAY
 *   1021 commit_unknown_result
 *                          the commit is no longer in flight; the
 *                          witness read decides landed / not landed
 *   1025 transaction_cancelled, 1031 transaction_timed_out,
 *   1039 cluster_version_changed
 *                          the commit MAY still be in flight; a fence
 *                          transaction decides landed / can never land
 *   anything else          MDS_ERR_IO
 * Deadline exhausted while an outcome is unresolved -> MDS_ERR_INDOUBT.
 *
 * Commit-outcome witness.  Each thread that runs a mutating body owns
 * one WITNESS slot (fdb_keys.h: WITNESS + mds_id + epoch + slot) for
 * its lifetime, with two keys: the witness key K_w, blind-set by every
 * mutating attempt to the attempt's fresh attempt_seq, and the fence
 * anchor K_f = K_w + 0x01 (fdb_key_witness_fence), which is never
 * written and on which every mutating attempt adds a READ and a WRITE
 * conflict range.  The anchor totally orders the attempts of a slot: a
 * commit from an earlier attempt cannot land after a later attempt
 * committed, and a later attempt whose read version predates an
 * earlier landing aborts with 1020 and re-runs.  On 1021 a fresh
 * default transaction (no GRV cache, no causal-read-risky) reads K_w:
 * equal to attempt_seq -> committed, else definitively not committed.
 * On 1025/1031/1039 a fence transaction (read K_w, add a WRITE conflict
 * range on K_f, no mutation) is committed first: committed and saw
 * attempt_seq -> landed; committed and did not -> the attempt can
 * never land (its READ conflict range on K_f now intersects the
 * fence's write) and the body may be re-run; fence failed -> retried
 * within the deadline.
 *
 * The fence only orders against an attempt whose read version precedes
 * the fence's commit: the resolver compares the attempt's read_snapshot
 * with the versions of the writes it conflicts with.  A body that did
 * not read has no read version yet and the client would take one inside
 * the commit -- possibly after the fence, in which case the fenced
 * attempt would still land.  The runner therefore waits for the
 * transaction's read version before it issues the commit (free when the
 * body read: the future is already ready; the commit's own GRV
 * otherwise, so no extra round trip either way).
 *
 * Why a separate, unwritten anchor: fdb_transaction_add_conflict_range
 * goes through the client's read-your-writes layer, which records a
 * READ conflict range only over the parts of the range the transaction
 * has NOT mutated itself (RYWImpl::updateConflictMap keeps unmodified
 * ranges only).  A READ range on the mutated witness key therefore
 * never reaches the resolver and a fence on that key intersects
 * nothing -- verified against libfdb_c 7.3 by tests/unit/test_fdb_txn.c
 * and the fault-injection suite.  Ranges on a key nobody mutates always
 * reach the resolver, in any call order; this is the construction the
 * client itself uses for its self-conflict key (\xFF/SC/<uid>).  The
 * same elision applies to a range the transaction CLEARS, so a body
 * must never clear a range that covers its handle's WITNESS table
 * (catalogue_fdb_keyspace_clear excludes it): the anchor would be
 * inside the cleared range, its READ range would be dropped and the
 * fence could not stop a late landing of that clear.
 *
 * A transaction object whose commit MAY still be in flight (1025/1031/
 * 1039) is never reused: the runner destroys it and creates a fresh one
 * for the re-run, and does the same with a resolver transaction whose
 * round ended that way.  fdb_transaction_reset is only equivalent to
 * destroy + create when no commit actor is outstanding on the object;
 * under the client's own fault injection (CLIENT_BUGGIFY) the delayed
 * in-flight commit still owns the object and a later commit on the
 * reused object trips the client's ASSERT(!committing.isValid())
 * (internal_error 4100).  After 1021 the client guarantees nothing is
 * in flight, so a reset is enough there.
 *
 * The epoch component is the process-wide incarnation stamp taken when
 * the client network starts (CLOCK_REALTIME ns), not the cluster
 * registry's boot_epoch: it is known before the first mutation, so it
 * never changes under an attempt in flight (a clear racing with an
 * unresolved attempt would erase a live witness and cause a double
 * apply), and every handle of one process shares it.  At open the
 * backend range-clears WITNESS + mds_id + [0, epoch): dead incarnations'
 * keys.  fdb_backend_set_boot_epoch() records the registry epoch for
 * rows that carry an owner epoch; it does not touch witness keys.
 *
 * Injection.  The fdb_c calls the runner itself makes go through
 * struct fdb_txn_calls (b->calls); tests script commit outcomes and
 * clock values through a mock table without a buggify build.  Bodies
 * call fdb_c directly through the helpers below.
